Ruin has come to our family.

You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor. I lived all my years in that ancient, rumour-shadowed manor.

Fattened by decadence and luxury... and yet I began to tire of conventional extravagance.

Singular, unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous, and unnameable power.

With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long-buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workmen, sturdy shovels.

At last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil.


Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness! In the end, I alone fled laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity, until consciousness failed me.

You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial...

It is a festering abomination...

I beg you, return home, claim your birthright, and deliver our family from the ravenous, clutching shadows

of the Darkest Dungeon.
