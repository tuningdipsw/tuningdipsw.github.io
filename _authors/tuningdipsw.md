Programmer of little acclaim.  
For a picture of my real face, or employment details, please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewjchsu) page.  
For my public programming work, please see my [GitHub](https://github.com/tuningdipsw) page.

My hobbies include fighting games, reading, and writing;  
appropriately, my current side project is a half-tutorial half-devblog series
on how to code a fighting game with the Pygame library.

Some of my favourite works include *Hellsinker.* and *Umineko no Naku Koro ni.*
I hope that you will one day give each story an honest try.
