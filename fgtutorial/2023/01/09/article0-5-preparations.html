<p>Good day. In this series of articles, I’ll be attempting to program a simple 2D fighting game using
the Python game development library Pygame.</p>

<p>Even after sitting through the previous article, we still have a bit of preparation to complete
before we can get started. Let’s get our prerequisites sorted out.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="install-python">Install Python</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></p>

<p>(2023/2/13)
The original Pygame library was only compatible with Python 3.10, forcing users
to download a less-recent version of Python,
but the <a href="https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce">Pygame community edition library</a>
that has taken its place is compatible with Python 3.11.</p>

<p>Confirm the installation by running</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 --version
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in a terminal.</p>

<h3 id="aside-a-first-roadblock-strategies-for-bugs">Aside: A first roadblock (Strategies for bugs)</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might run into your first error here. Don’t panic, errors are going to happen a lot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The instructions you’re following may be out-of-date, or even outright wrong.</li>
  <li>You may have simply mistyped something; maybe you read a 0 (zero) as an O (capital o),
or your Mac autocorrected a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code> (two hyphens, often used for command-line flag) into a – (em dash).</li>
  <li>Maybe you just did something wrong. If it won’t take too long, run it again from the beginning
just to be sure. <em>(Do a sanity check)</em></li>
  <li>Sometimes your computer is just very strange and nothing anyone has suggested works.
I’m very sorry if you have to go through one of these.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the case, here’s some of the basic steps you should try to solve an error:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try to reproduce the error.
    <ul>
      <li>Learning the possible conditions that may cause it might help you understand why it happens.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Paste the error text into Google.
    <ul>
      <li>The exact error text will often have bits specific to your program or particular run that
obviously won’t appear in others’ questions, so you will likely need to pare down the text a bit.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the error readout/stack trace will have multiple errors in it. More often than not, you
only want the one closest to the bottom since it’s the one causing the rest of errors, but give the others a skim.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1570463473011920897">Stop and read the error again, more carefully this time.</a></li>
  <li>After giving the problem an honest try, ask others for help on StackOverflow or a relevant Discord.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Just the act of trying to cleanly articulate what’s wrong may give you insight.</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside>
<i>"Why are you using Windows?"</i>
<br />
<br />
It's true:
The fickly-updated, too-user-"friendly" Windows is the root of many, many compatibility issues in programming,
so most programmers recommend working on Mac or Linux instead for pure coding.
<br />
<br />
However, the inconvenience of booting up Linux on an emulator/another disc on my cheeks laptop
completely torpedoes my motivation to write articles or code, so I've stubbornly
arranged my workflow around working past Windows' idiosyncrasies.
<br />
<br />
It is in no way optimal, but it has proven manageable thus far.
I may switch to Linux someday, but for the time being, this is a compromise I have made to deal with my own mental blocks.
</aside>

<p>Advice for this error on Windows, if you can’t figure it out:</p>
<p class="spoiler">
On Windows, this is usually caused by the location of the newly-installed Python executable being absent from the PATH
environment variable. Try searching for "how to add python path environment variable windows".
You may also need to restart your computer for the environment variable changes to take effect.
</p>

<p>The latter two are a bit lengthy and harsh to the reader, but if you’re willing to swallow your pride,
all three of these articles teach you best practices for how to ask for help in a way that will improve your
chances of getting a good answer.</p>

<p>I recommend giving them a read when you have a bit of time.</p>

<h2 id="2023212-new-install-pygame-community-edition">(2023/2/12: New) Install Pygame Community Edition</h2>

<p>Due to issues with the original Pygame project being able to update to Python 3.11 compatibility,
a new fork of the Pygame project, <a href="https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce">pygame-community</a>,
has been adopted to support Python 3.11 and more frequent updates.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce#installation">Installation is pretty straightforward:</a></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install pygame-ce
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can uninstall the original pygame if you had it installed; you should not need to adjust any other files.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip uninstall pygame
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, as a sanity check, try getting <a href="https://pyga.me/docs/#quick-start">a quick program</a> to work.
You might need to install an IDE first, though:</p>

<h2 id="install-and-configure-your-ide-of-choice">Install and configure your IDE of choice</h2>

<p>As mentioned in #0, don’t settle for accepting pain points, try to eliminate or reduce them
however you can. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) should be the program you write most, if not
all of your code in, as they provide much-needed quality-of-life features (eg. text autocompletion,
bracket highlighting, test runners plugins, Git integration) for development. I recommend
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>, an excellent, free pick with robust
support from its developers and plugin writers.</p>

<p>Another option I found for Python is Spyder IDE + Anaconda. I haven’t tried this myself, but it was
recommended to me by <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/discover-python-and-patterns-1">another Pygame tutorial</a>
I found very helpful.</p>

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting">(1)</a>
<a href="https://www.emmanuelgautier.com/blog/enable-vscode-python-type-checking">(2)</a>
</aside>

<p>Some optional settings or plugins you might like to set up at this point include
a <a href="https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/#linters">linter</a>
or a <a href="https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/">type checker</a>.</p>

<h2 id="optional-set-up-version-control-software-git">(Optional) Set up Version Control Software (Git)</h2>

<p>You don’t need to set up VCS to write code, but having it set up will help you keep track of
your project changes. There are a number of VCS options out there, but Git is the one I’m familiar with.</p>

<h3 id="motivations-for-using-vcs">Motivations for using VCS</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You’d like to segment your changes into nice, discrete chunks instead of letting everything
blend together into a continuous stream of changes. <em>(git commit)</em></li>
  <li>You’d like to be able to see which parts of your program you’ve made changes to since your last commit.
<em>(git diff, also displayed passively in IDEs with Git integration)</em></li>
  <li>You’d like the ability to view, and in a worst-case scenario, revert back to, previous versions
of your codebase. <em>(git revert)</em></li>
  <li>Similarly, being able to easily and safely apply and unapply a set of temporary changes to
see what the difference looks like. <em>(git stash)</em></li>
  <li>You’d like to be able to fluidly upload and download a record of your changes to/from the web,
in the off-chance your filesystem explodes. <em>(remote repository like GitHub)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I would consider having the ability to do all of these an integral part of development QOL.
Better to have it and not need it than the other way around, after all.</p>

<aside>
* There is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version of Git available for users who don't wish to
learn the command line commands. I find it much faster to use the command line instead, but it is an option
available to you to help you learn the basic workflow.
</aside>

<p>Git can be intimidating to learn
due to the combination of having a very long command list available and being invoked through the
command line*, but these are things that can be overcome. Take a bit of time, learn something new,
and you’ll have a handy new tool in your toolbox.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the basic Git workflow most of your Git usage will resemble:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># In the root of your project folder, generate a Git repository</span>
<span class="c"># Only need to do this once</span>
git init

<span class="c"># Get a look at the list of changed/uncommitted files</span>
git status

<span class="c"># Add a single file to the list of files to be committed</span>
git add filename.txt

<span class="c"># OR Use a pattern and the wildcard * to add all files starting with "filename."</span>
<span class="c"># to the list of files to be committed</span>
git add filename.<span class="k">*</span> 

<span class="c"># OR What the heck, add all files</span>
git add <span class="nb">.</span> 

<span class="c"># Look again, check which files have been staged</span>
git status 

<span class="c"># Ok, not that file, put that one back</span>
<span class="c"># Unstage this file from the list of files to be included in the next commit</span>
<span class="c"># Maybe write a .gitignore file to automatically prevent this one from ever getting added</span>
git restore <span class="nt">--staged</span> passwords.txt

<span class="c"># Tie it all up in a bow with a message</span>
git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"Descriptive message summarizing this chunk of changes"</span>

<span class="c"># View the newly-updated commit log for your sanity</span>
git log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some other useful commands include:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Split into a new development branch (eg. for experimental feature</span>
<span class="c"># or a new version release)</span>
<span class="c"># For your personal work, you might not need this, but it is an option</span>
git branch
git branch list
git checkout

<span class="c"># Revert to last commit, saving all uncommitted changes away</span>
<span class="c"># on an invisible stack saved by Git</span>
git stash

<span class="c"># Put the last-stashed set of changes back into play, popping it off</span>
<span class="c"># the stack of set-of-changes stored by Git</span>
git stash pop

<span class="c"># Quickly undo all uncommitted changes to a file</span>
<span class="c"># Overlaps with the command to unstage a file from the list of files to be included in a commit</span>
<span class="c"># just with no --staged flag, try very hard to avoid using this accidentally</span>
<span class="c"># ! This can erase all your changes even if saved, and can't be undone through Git, be VERY careful</span>
git restore filename.txt

<span class="c"># Read more about this and soft/hard reverts at your own leisure</span>
git revert
</code></pre></div></div>
