Site under construction.

DIP switches were used by arcade games to allow settings like difficulty, cost per play, number of lives, etc.

More specifically, *Hellsinker.*, the 2008 doujin shmup released by Ruminant's Whimper, uses "TUNING DIPSW" as the alias for its settings menu.

The phrase "DIP switch" carries an unfortunate resemblance to another disparaging word, although this was not intended by the author of this site. Let's aim to keep it excellent and mindful.

```python
print("test CodeRay python highlighting")
for char in "shrine":
    print(char)
