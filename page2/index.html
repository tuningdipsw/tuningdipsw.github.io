  <p><a href="/fgtutorial/2023/01/30/article1-gameloop.html">« Prev: #1: Introducing our game loop</a></p>

<p>This is a bit of a side article to article #1 (Introducing our game loop), filled with bits
I thought were ultimately unnecessary to the main tutorial and ended up cutting
during my editing pass.</p>

<p>Here are some fun bits of writing and hopefully informative I couldn’t quite bring myself to cut completely.
If you’re stuck in a tutorial-reading haze, I would really recommend just skipping to #2
instead of reading through this, but if you’d just like to read a little more,
I’ve left this here for you.</p>

<p>Good day. In this series of articles, I’ll be attempting to program a simple 2D
fighting game using the Python game development library Pygame.</p>

<p>Teaching the game loop design pattern is a common part of any game programming tutorial,
so there’s already plenty of coverage on this topic on the internet,
but we’ll go over it again, since it is quite important, and it sets up our next few
topics quite nicely.</p>

<p>I won’t be regurgitating the lessons of authors who’ve done it better, but I hope to
add some useful commentary on how the game loop looks in the context of our fighting game.</p>

<p>Good day. In this series of articles, I’ll be attempting to program a simple 2D
fighting game using the Python game development library Pygame.</p>

<p>“Rollback netcode”. “GGPO”. <a href="https://twitter.com/jiyunaJP/status/1616477744556314625">“Sajam”.</a>
These are the words of the hour when it comes to good netplay, and fighting game players today
have raised their standards to the point where the inability to play the game
smoothly online is an instant deal-breaker for many.</p>

<p>If you’re a small fighting game developer, you cannot afford to turn away
anyone who might be interested in your game, just because you think delay-based is good enough.</p>

<p>(Frankly, even if you are a large one, you might not be able to afford to turn those people away either.)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/article0-8/yikes.jpg" alt="Flag of the GBVS not-rollback announcement" /></p>

<p><em>Battle standard of the GBVS not-rollback announcement</em></p>

<p>Fortunately, implementing rollback netcode in your game is more than possible as a solo dev.<br />
Let’s take a look at how.</p>

<p>Even after sitting through the previous article, we still have a bit of preparation to complete
before we can get started. Let’s get our prerequisites sorted out.</p>

  <p>Good day. In this series of articles, I’ll be attempting to program a simple 2D
fighting game using the Python game development library Pygame, documenting the
process as I do so, working through the problem, the logic, and the code. There
might be some arbitrary flavour tangents included as well, as I am not being
paid to omit them.</p>
