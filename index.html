  <p><a href="https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/strategic-policy-sector/en/marketplace-framework-policy/consultation-paper-consultation-copyright-age-generative-artificial-intelligence">“Consultation on Copyright in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence” (2023)</a></p>

<p>Good day. I am writing in to express my concerns on the use of generative AI as an artist.</p>

<p>Although I do not have any weigh-in on how the government might regulate or enforce the use of generative AI in its legislation, I’d like to raise these concerns about generative AI for the Government of Canada to consider.</p>

<p>There are a number of detrimental effects to the current practice of generative AI that can be observed today. Some of these fall outside of the copyright domain that “Consultation on Copyright in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence” (2023) focuses on, but I will bring them up for your consideration.</p>

<p>My general view is that genAI in the hands of bad actors has the potential to do great harm, and that the potential benefits of genAI are narrower as its most vocal proponents would have me believe, such that I do not believe that they outweigh the negatives of removing genAI from our internet ecosystem.</p>

<p>However, I acknowledge the difficulties in regulating/legislating/enforcing genAI in the hands of the generic bad actor; Pandora’s Box has been opened, and we cannot put genAI back in the box.</p>

  <p>Good day. It’s been a few months since my last update.<br />
I took a break from working on this project in order to focus my full effort on finding employment. Unfortunately, this remains a continuing effort.<br />
As that long try trusting in my current skills and experience turned up little, I’ve decided to return to self-study to salve the areas I lack in.</p>

<p>Good day. In this series of articles, I’ll be attempting to program a simple 2D
fighting game using the Python game development library Pygame.</p>

<p>We’ve created a system to translate key presses into logical buttons,
but they don’t <em>do</em> anything yet; we have no concept of an action,
nor even a concept of a character with which to perform one.</p>

<p>Let’s start getting that set up.</p>

  <p><a href="/fgtutorial/2023/02/06/article2-inputs.html">« Prev: #2: Inputs</a></p>

<p>Good day. In this series of articles, I’ll be attempting to program a simple 2D
fighting game using the Python game development library Pygame.</p>

<p>It is technically possible to write code without testing, in the same way that it
is technically possible to draw with your eyes closed.</p>

<p>Both regular testing, by running your game, and automated testing,
by writing a suite of tests after making changes to your game,
allow you to be more confident about the correctness of your code,
and help catch bugs your new changes might introduce.</p>

<p>You might feel that writing tests is an unnecessary chore.<br />
I also felt that way before I wrote these tests,
but I think I wouldn’t have that gut reaction if I’d just found
just the tutorial I was looking for to show me how to do it.</p>

<p>For that reason, I’ll be sharing a brief account of what I did to set up
unit testing for article #2. I hope you find it useful.</p>

<p>Good day. In this series of articles, I’ll be attempting to program a simple 2D
fighting game using the Python game development library Pygame.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to create is the input system of our game.
Although it is an intriguing idea, we won’t be taking after <em>NetHack</em> or <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>
and binding actions to single buttons (no ‘q’ to quaff). We must
instead find a way to decide whether a player’s (eg.) “236P” input should trigger a
special move or a command normal (6P).</p>
