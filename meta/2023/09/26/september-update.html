<p>Good day. It’s been a few months since my last update.<br />
I took a break from working on this project in order to focus my full effort on finding employment. Unfortunately, this remains a continuing effort.<br />
As that long try trusting in my current skills and experience turned up little, I’ve decided to return to self-study to salve the areas I lack in. <!--more-->
To start with, I’ve decide to commit to pushing through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> in order to learn more full-stack technologies.</p>

<p>As for the fighting game tutorial, the loss of momentum hurts me quite a bit.<br />
I was already beginning to stall out on direction when I decided to take a break in March to focus on job searching, so it’s not surprising that I don’t have much drive to pick it back up again.</p>

<p>I think I do want to work on a project of my own outside of the aforementioned full-stack study, but it might be better if it were something smaller than a fighting game.<br />
The research material I was reading in my attempt to synthesize the next step of my game kind of overwhelmed me, I think. But it wasn’t a bad experience in programming or in writing, even if it didn’t make it very far.</p>

<p>The desire to make this tutorial hasn’t died completely though. I’d like to come back and tackle it again someday in the future.</p>

<p>The recent debacle with Unity, which shattered the trust developers had placed in them, pushed developers to other engines and frameworks, like Godot Engine. (Some amateur discussion of this appears in Article #0 of the tutorial.)<br />
But <a href="https://blood.church/posts/2023-09-14-whatistobedone">an article encouraging developers to try writing their own engine</a> caught my eye.</p>

<p>I’d defaulted to options like LOVE2D and Pygame because I hadn’t known how to start with anything else, but this article spoke a lot about how to get started with the tools for making your own lower-level engine. I’ve become a little curious.<br />
I’ve never done much low-level stuff, so I’d like to at least read about a little of the stuff that goes into making a framework or engine. It may be interesting to research even if I never quite get past the reading phase.<br />
I haven’t fully formed an idea of what kind of bite-sized game I’d like to make for this, but it’s been on my mind.</p>

<p>That’s all for now.<br />
I will continue to tackle each task as they come.<br />
Until next time.</p>
